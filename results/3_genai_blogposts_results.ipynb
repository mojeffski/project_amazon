It runs perfectly for my need.', 'Weight is perfect.Size is right. It fits anywhereView is sharp, day or night', 'This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.', \"This is great for reading, it's light and easy to read. I love it.\", 'I love the new kindle. I have a third generation and the new features are awesome.', 'I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading.', 'My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously', 'This is a great reader. As a tablet it will not replace my iPad', \"I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!\"]\n",
      "[\"This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!\", \"I previously had a first edition paper white and finally pulled the trigger on a voyage. I'm so glad I did, the resolution is great and it seems easier to read. I also like that the screen is completely flat. I don't really use the page turn buttons like I thought i would but it is nice to have the option.\", 'I have several generations of Kindle readers, and this is far and away the best. It is relatively expensive, but the features are worth it.', 'Works great, looks great, readable in bright sun...', 'bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it', 'Bought two for gifts. A huge hit!! They are readers and love not having to lug books.', 'I also have a Nook Glow but I miss having buttons. The \"squeeze the edge\" for a page turn is what sold me.', \"I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect! (Advice: Ask Amazon to remove the ads if you're a Prime member!)\"]\n",
      "['The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. Can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. Slim and lightweight when not using a case which I appreciate most about this kindle. Makes for easy holding and carrying/packing. Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up. We can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. This is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go. I would give it 4.5 if that was an option.', \"I love my kindle voyage. It is very little weight and I love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. You can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with.\", 'Love my Kindle! I take it with me everywhere! I would recommend this to all my friends and family!', 'Kindle voyage is the costliest of the kindle range but its worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight.

      "[\"My family really enjoys the Amazon Echo. We have it set up to automate our home and remind us of things that are in our schedules. We picked up the Echo and two of the Echo Dots. We love to play our music and control our television by just simply telling it to do so. Locate your phone with one of the skills. I purchased one for my mother so she can use My Buddy if she gets hurt and call for someone if she can't get to her phone. There is a lot of potential for development in home automation as well as the connected automobile.\", 'Got it for the sole purpose of controlling my home lighting. Works perfect!', 'Family is having fun using ECHO. We use it as an alarm, for time, music, weather and getting answers to some of our questions.', \"The sound is good, and it gets really loud. New features are always added, and it is compatible with a growing list of products. *The less awesome part: I've found that if I go to max volume, Alexa can't hear me even if I scream right next to her.\", 'Set up was easy. Alexa so far has been on target and extremely helpful.', 'Love the echo. Great for listening to music and quick information', 'What an amazing device. I can ask it questions about sports, weather, traffic, music ... it tells me jokes, provides me with interesting trivia, turns on my lights in the morning, turns them off at night, plays music and many other useful tricks. This will again revolutionize home functionality in our lives.']\n",
      "['Purchased the Echo as a bridal shower gift. My niece and her fianc are still learning about all it can do but already reported back to me that they love it. I was told it is the most favorite gift they received.', \"Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry.\", 'We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa.', \"I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet.\", 'The Amazon Echo has very good voice recognition. It works just as advertised and is quick with the responses. I was glad to see it at best buy so I could touch it and try it before I bought it. The setup was easy and quick.', \"This thing does so many things it's incredible. Time saver, information finder , and even a family entertainer!\", 'We love this product, and are having so much fun with it. I can make a shopping list with it, get news, weather forecast , play our favorite music and so many other things that I have yet to discover.', 'Very versatile device that is constantly updated by Amazon.

Speakers could be better, but a great device for fun and information!', 'I like this speaker.great product from Amazon.all what I need', 'The device is great to have in your home...like asking what the weather would be like...playing your favorite sound etc.', \"Love the Echo!! Love that it's all voice command even the vloume!\", 'Bought as a Christmas gift, everything seems great.', 'ITS PERFECT. I LOVE MY ALEXA. DOES EVERYTHING I WANT IT TO DO', \"This is a good starter. As the company provides more devices that it can control it will become excellent. It's very limited at this time.\", \"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.\", \"The echo is so much fun to play with and works great with Amazon and hue products. It's very hard to get it to work with our iPhone and iTunes. I can't figure out how to get my iTunes playlist to work or sync it to my calander from phone. I'm sure it's possible because my tech skills are mediocre at best. Had I known what a pain this would be I would have looked into the google product more closely. The echo itself is a great product but I would not buy it again unless they open it up to other providers services.\", 'While comparing to other competitive products the Echo appeared to be the best. Purchased as a gift for a family memeber.', 'I love this product. My wife was not too happy at first because I placed in our bedroom. Now she loves it as she can listen to music when she is putting on her make up in the mornings.', \"My wife loves it and it's a lot of fun. The music is great and it's amazing how much Alexa understands.\", 'Thos is awesome does everything it says and more only thing is its not portable but amazon sells a aftermarket charger base that makes it portable', 'have not used it yet but excited to try it, looks like it would be fun!', \"I'm not normally a techie person, but I read so many positive things about Amazon's Echo and Alexa, I splurged and gave it a try. I absolutely love it! Of course asking questions about traffic, weather, recipes, etc. can be a blast, but I have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music I'm in the mood for, and even change my mind a few minutes later, without having to sort through CD's or putz around with the various 'plays' or radio stations on my phone or laptop. Definitely a gadget worth the money!!\", 'I pick it for one feature but it does so much more. I rave about it to everyone', 'This device is easy to use and I like it very much.', \"This was purchased to have a second Echo in the house. The first one I have was placed in the living/kitchen area, as I use it to play music, add notes (a lot of items to my shopping lists) and appointments/reminders to my calendar. I love having a second Echo in the bedroom to give me the news brief in the morning, give me a status of the traffic and weather conditions, play music, etc. I've noticed a lot of imitations popping up by different companies, however, Echo is the best and has become an integral part of our house and lives. It sounds dramatic, but it's definitely true. Amazon constantly updates and adds new abilities/features. The ability to link it to lights, thermostat, etc. let's me think we are keeping up with the Jetsons! Highly recommend buying an Echo!\"]\n"

      "I bought the Kindle PaperWhite because I wanted to read books on my Kindle. This was my first Kindle and I was very impressed with the quality of this product. However, I have to say that the paper is very thin and the pages are very small. Also, the cover is not very thick and it is difficult to open. Overall, it was a good product but it does not have the same quality as the other Kindle products. If you are looking for a Kindle, this is a great option for you. But, if you want a thicker Kindle cover, you will have a hard time finding one. You can find a lot of Kindle covers online. Amazon has a wide selection of covers. They are all very good quality. There are also some Kindle books that are available in paper covers and they are not as good as Kindle paper. So, be careful when you buy a paper Kindle book. Some of them are made of paper and some are plastic. Plastic Kindle Book covers are much cheaper than paper ones. And, they do not last as long. Paper Kindle Books are more durable and last longer. In addition, there are some paper Kindles that have been discontinued. These are the kind of books you can still find on Amazon.com. For example, The Kindle Classics series. Kindle Classic books are great for reading. Although, some of these books have not been updated in a long time. Most of those books were written in the late 90s and early 2000s. Now, these are still available on Kindle Unlimited. Another great Kindle option is Kindle Voyage. Voyages are Kindle e-readers that come with a book that you read on your Kindle device. A Kindle is an electronic device that is used to display books, magazines, newspapers, and other information. Kindle is also a brand of electronic devices that can be used for ebooks, music, movies, games, etc. All Kindled devices are electronic and are used in conjunction with an Internet connection. When you use a Kindler device,\n",

      "The Amazon Fire HD 6 is the latest addition to the Fire TV line. With a new design, it is now a full-size HDTV. Amazon has also added a number of new features to make it even better. One of the most important features is that it has a built-in speaker. You can now use the Amazon Alexa voice assistant to play music, control the TV, or even control other devices. There is also a remote control that you can use to change the channel, pause the show, change channels, etc. If you have a Fire tablet, you will be able to use it to stream content from Amazon.com. In addition, the new Fire is able play content on your FireTV, Fire tablets, Amazon Kindle Fire, Android tablets and Amazon's own Fire OS devices, including the Kindle. All of these devices are compatible. For the first time, there is an Amazon app for the Android TV. And, of course, all of this is available on Amazon Prime. So, if you are looking for a TV that is easy to set up, has all the features you need, is very affordable, but is still very powerful, then the HD Fire 6 may be the best TV you could ever buy. We have reviewed the previous generation of Fire TVs, so we know what we are talking about. But, we also know that the next generation is going to be even more powerful. That is why we have decided to review the 6th generation Fire. Here is what you get with the 5th-generation Fire:\n",

       "{'computers & tablets': ['I bought the Kindle PaperWhite because I wanted to read books on my Kindle. This was my first Kindle and I was very impressed with the quality of this product. However, I have to say that the paper is very thin and the pages are very small. Also, the cover is not very thick and it is difficult to open. Overall, it was a good product but it does not have the same quality as the other Kindle products. If you are looking for a Kindle, this is a great option for you. But, if you want a thicker Kindle cover, you will have a hard time finding one. You can find a lot of Kindle covers online. Amazon has a wide selection of covers. They are all very good quality. There are also some Kindle books that are available in paper covers and they are not as good as Kindle paper. So, be careful when you buy a paper Kindle book. Some of them are made of paper and some are plastic. Plastic Kindle Book covers are much cheaper than paper ones. And, they do not last as long. Paper Kindle Books are more durable and last longer. In addition, there are some paper Kindles that have been discontinued. These are the kind of books you can still find on Amazon.com. For example, The Kindle Classics series. Kindle Classic books are great for reading. Although, some of these books have not been updated in a long time. Most of those books were written in the late 90s and early 2000s. Now, these are still available on Kindle Unlimited. Another great Kindle option is Kindle Voyage. Voyages are Kindle e-readers that come with a book that you read on your Kindle device. A Kindle is an electronic device that is used to display books, magazines, newspapers, and other information. Kindle is also a brand of electronic devices that can be used for ebooks, music, movies, games, etc. All Kindled devices are electronic and are used in conjunction with an Internet connection.

       "  \"I've been using the Echo for a few weeks now and it has been a huge hit. It's so easy to use and the voice recognition is so good. My only complaint is that the battery life is pretty short. If you're going for the best battery, I would recommend getting the Fire HD 8GB. That's the only thing I can think of that would make it better. But I don’t think that‘s the case. Amazon has a ton of great products and they”re not going away. They“re just going up in price. So if I were you, the next best thing is to go with the Kindle Fire. You can get a lot of the same stuff for less money. And if it„s not the right size, you‟ll be able to find a better deal. There are a couple of other things I‚m going through right now that I really like. One is their new smart light. This thing has really cool features. For example, it can tell you if your light is on or off. Another one is this thing that they call the “Smart Lock‖. Basically, this is like a smart key that can open your door. Now, if that doesn›t work for you then you could always just use your key. Or you might want to try the door lock. Again, that might not work. Then you have the smart lock that has an app that will let you know if there‹s a door open or closed. All of these things are really great.‡\\nThe Amazon Fire is one of my favorite devices. However, there are some things that are not as good as the other devices in the lineup. First, Amazon doesn't have a good selection of apps for their devices, so you'll have to download them from\",\n",
       "  'The tablet is very light and easy to hold. It is also very easy for me to read the screen. I have used it for a few days and I am very happy with it. My only complaint is that the battery life is not as good as I would like. If you are looking for an affordable tablet that is light, easy and has a good battery, this is the one for you. You can also get the Amazon Fire HD 8.9 tablet for $199.99. This is a great deal. Amazon also has the Kindle Fire 7.1 tablet which is $99 and the Fire TV Stick for only $49.95. These are great deals. There are also other tablets that are cheaper but not quite as light as the fire tablet. For example, the Asus Transformer Book T100 is only about $100 and is quite light. However, it is still a tablet and not a laptop. So, if your looking to buy a light tablet, you should look at the lightest tablet on Amazon.com. That is why I recommend the tablet above. But, I do recommend that you look for the best tablet you can find. And, that tablet should be light enough to be used as a notebook. Otherwise, your tablet will be too heavy to use as your laptop or tablet computer. Also, look into the price of the tablets. Some of them are very expensive. Look for one that has good value for your money. Then, go for it!\\nI am a big fan of Amazon and have been for years. They have a wide selection of products and are always willing to help me find the right product for my needs. Their customer service is always prompt and helpful. In fact, they have helped me with my Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. Now, with the new Kindle, Amazon has made it even easier to find what I need. With the latest Kindle tablet I can now find my favorite books, movies, music, and more. All I had to do was go to Amazon, search for what my book or movie was, then click on it'],\n",

When I plug it in, it recognizes it and the screen turns on, but it does not recognize the Kindle and does nothing. If I try to turn it on it just goes to the Amazon logo and nothing else. Any ideas?\\nThe Amazon Kindle is the best device I've ever used. My wife and kids love the device and have used it to read books, magazines, and newspapers. They love to use it as well. But, when I turn on my Amazon Fire, the only thing it shows is Amazon.com. No Kindle logo. This is not a good thing. Please help. Thanks. --\\nKindles are great devices, especially for the price. Amazon has a lot of great deals on them. You can get a new one for $100, or a used one that is still working for about $20. There are also a ton of Kindle apps for your phone, tablet, computer, etc. that you can use to get the most out of your Kindle, including Kindle books. Kindle ebooks are available for free on Kindle's website. And, if you have an Amazon Prime account, you get free two-day shipping on all Kindle purchases. So, there are a bunch of ways to save money on your Amazon purchases, even if they are not Kindle-specific. Just make sure you read the fine print on any deals you find. Also, be sure to check out the reviews on Amazon before you buy. Some people have had bad experiences with Amazon, so be careful. Good luck!\\nAmazon has an excellent selection of books and other items. In addition, Amazon offers a wide variety of e-books, music, movies, audiobooks, games, apps, eBooks, Kindle devices and more. All of these items are free to download and use. For example, here are some of the books that are currently\",\n",

It is very light, has a great screen, and is a very good tablet. However, I am having a hard time getting it working with my iPhone. When I plug it into my phone, it doesn't recognize it. If I try to sync my playlist, iTunes, or Calander, the device just doesn’t work. My phone is an iPhone 4S, so I don‘t know if that is causing the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\\nThe Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is available in two sizes: 10-inch and 12-incher. Both sizes are available with a 10,000 mAh battery. Amazon has also released a smaller version of the tablet, called the Fire Mini. Like the larger tablet it is also available as a single- or dual-SIM device. There is no mention of a microSD card slot, which is nice. Pricing is $199 for the 10 inch tablet and $249 for a 12 inch version. You can also buy the smaller tablet for $99.99, with the same battery life.
